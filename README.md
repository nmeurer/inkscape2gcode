# inkscape2gcode

Added a X, Y and Z offset function to the tool.


## Installation

Unzip the files directly into the Inkscape user extensions folder. Inkscape lists the location of your extensions folder under **Edit** > **Preferences** > **System**.

Restart Inkscape and you're done.

## Documentation

More documentation coming soon. In the meantime you can refer to [JTP's official website](https://jtechphotonics.com/?page_id=2012).

## For developers

Pull requests are welcome. Just make sure to test your code on both Python >=2.6 and >=3.5 for the main branch, and Python >= 3.6 for the development branch (In the next major release we'll drop support for older python versions in an effort to improve code readability).
