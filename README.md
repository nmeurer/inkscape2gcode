# inkscape2gcode

An optimized version of the JTP Laser-Tool Inkscape extension for use with 3D-Printers

## Features compared to the JTP Laser-Tool
- added a X, Y and Z offset function
- full, only X and Y or no homing at all can be performed
- option to disable moving to X0 Y0 after the tool is done
- option to notify the user via a buzzer

## Installation

Unzip the files directly into the Inkscape user extensions folder. Inkscape lists the location of your extensions folder under **Edit** > **Preferences** > **System**.

Restart Inkscape and you're done.

## Documentation

More documentation coming soon. In the meantime you can refer to [JTP's official website](https://jtechphotonics.com/?page_id=2012).
